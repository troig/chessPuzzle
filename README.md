chessPuzzle
===========

Find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on  a chess board with dimensions MÃ—N where none of the
pieces is in a position to take any of the others.

Write a program which takes as input:
- The dimensions of the board: M, N.
- The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

As output, the program should list all the unique configurations to the console for which all of the pieces can be
placed on the board without threatening each other.
